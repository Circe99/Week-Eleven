# My 'Barely Game'

This was a process. I went in thinking of this will be hard, them I started and though oh no this is so easy, then a few minutes later I saw that I was not clicking on the dialog button for each new spirit I made, so I just erased and added the new text to the same spirit over and over again... At least now I know for next time. 

I added all of the tombs that I added to the database, I'm not sure how to expand the room to add more tombs comfortably, but I would like to maybe make a new page for each location that people can explore. (maybe something I will work on next week) 

I also would love to make it so that the layout matches the actual site, but because I don't have access to all that data at the moment, it may not workout. 

Additionally, I played the game a bit (its pretty short) and noticed that sometimes my dialog is empty because of the page break I added and then sometimes the text moves on to the next dialog, but I was consistent with each tomb so I have no idea why it's doing that. 

I added my game to the repo this week, but I don't know how to link it! When I opened the_graveyard_project.html it showed the code, which is all good and dandy, but I want to share the game with you! I hope to figure this out for next week and I will ask the group how other people did it, but I had a lot of fun making this and trying to figure out what colours to use, what shapes to make the tombs, what order to write the info, etc.
