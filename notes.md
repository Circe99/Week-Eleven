# My 'Barely Game'

This was a process. I went in thinking of this will be hard, them I started and though oh no this is so easy, then a few minutes later I saw that I was not clicking on the dialog button for each new spirit I made, so I just erased and added the new text to the same spirit over and over again... At least now I know for next time. 

I added all of the tombs that I added to the database, I'm not sure how to expand the room to add more tombs comfortably, but I would like to maybe make a new page for each location that people can explore. (maybe something I will work on next week) 

I also would love to make it so that the layout matches the actual site, but because I don't have access to all that data at the moment, it may not workout. 

Additionally, I played the game a bit (its pretty short) and noticed that sometimes my dialog is empty because of the page break I added and then sometimes the text moves on to the next dialog, but I was consistent with each tomb so I have no idea why it's doing that. 

Here is the game! I had so much fun making it so I hope you enjoy trying it out. I know it's really basic so hopefully I can make it more interesting next week, but I loved experimenting with the shape of the tombs and the colours, and then deciding how I wanted the dialogs to be read out, and what information to add. (If you have any ideas or recommendations on what you think would be a good addition I would love to hear it!)
