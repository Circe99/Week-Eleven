I'm sorry! I didn't have time to read anything this week simply because it was a hectic week for my other classes so I won't be able to reflect my work back to the readings for now. However, I would like to say that while I was working on the game, I spent a lot of time thinking about the colour I wanted to use, the shapes I made each thing (aka the tomb and person) and the overall layout of my game (which I have yet to figure out how to link so I promise this will make sense when I do finally send it to you). But it made me consider how we have discussed ethics all semester, and it applies just as much in my own little made up world. How do I want to represent these things? Do I want it to be fun and colour like many of the games I have played? Do I want to add actual data? Do I want to make the layout as close to the locations I am using as possible? These are all things I have thought about while working on my game and will continue to think about as I add more to it.
